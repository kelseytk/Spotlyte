## Available Scripts

'npm install' to install the necessary packages to run Spotlyte.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The local address will redirect you to a Spotify log-in prompt - this will provide the Spotlyte app with access to the scopes requested (playlist information) from your Spotify account for one hour.

After authorization is complete, you will be prompted to enter a Spotify playlist URL (sharable link). Once entered, submit the data - please be patient as it is parsing through a lot of information!

After a brief period, the app will provide you with a chart including the song names, artists, and respective playcounts of each song in the playlist - these metrics can be used to reorder the data by clicking on the metric titles.
